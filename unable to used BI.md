Assessment solution 
**Due to some reason my machine does not work with powerBI which didnt enable me making report. so i share step which i want to generate report in bi**
Used Power BI 
In that i Configure the appropriate database connector in your BI tool to establish a connection with the database.
Provide the necessary details such as the database type, host, port, username, password, and database name.
Test the connection to ensure it is successful.

Check chosen BI tool has built-in data lineage tracking capabilities.
If data lineage tracking is not available out of the box. Configure the data lineage tracking tool to capture and record the lineage information, including the source database, transformations, and any other relevant details.

after that set up the necessary data transformations in your BI tool to prepare the data for analysis.
This include filtering, aggregation, joining multiple tables, or creating calculated fields based on the retrieved data.
Create reports, visualizations, or dashboards to display the trending tags data.

I use appropriate chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts, pie charts) to represent the data visually and facilitate analysis.
Configure the BI tool to schedule periodic data refreshes from the database.

at last set the frequency based on your requirements (e.g., daily, weekly) to keep the data up-to-date.
Automate the data extraction, transformation, and loading processes using built-in features or external ETL tools.
Ensure that the data lineage tracking is maintained during each refresh cycle.
